# Assignmatts

This is my personal library of templates and helper functions for my various
assignments, labs, and projects at university.

This has been turned into a package so that:

- I can import it from my `@local` namespace even from different course
  directories.
- So that my friends, who I'm trying to get to use Typst, can use the same theme
  as me. ðŸ˜„


## Installation

I'm not going to bother putting this on the Typst package repository (at least
not until they add themes as their own thing). Unfortunately, you can't
`#import` from a Git URL yet; to install this package, follow [Typst's guide on
local packages][package-install].

The easiest way to install this package is probably to clone it into your
`{data-dir}` (again, see Typst's guide). More specifically, you can clone a
specific version without any extra history by setting the `--depth` flag to `1`
and using `--branch` to target a tag on this repository.

On Windows, Typst's `{data-dir}` is located in `%LOCALAPPDATA%`.

For convenience (as in, mostly for my own convenience), here's a Bash snippet
that will install the latest version.

```bash
VER="$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/matthew-e-brown/assignmatts/releases/latest | jq -r '.tag_name')"
DIR="${LOCALAPPDATA}/typst/packages/local/assignmatts"
mkdir -p "$DIR" # will do nothing if already exists
git clone git@github.com:matthew-e-brown/assignmatts.git --branch "$VER" --depth 1 "$DIR/${VER/v}"
rm -rf "$DIR/${VER/v}/.git" # No need to keep it as a git repo
```

This requires having [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed, of course.
Just get it from `winget`. You can safely ignore the detached-HEAD warning from
Git.
